# Commodore VIC-20 Schematic and PCB for assembly 250403

Hard forked from https://github.com/StormTrooper/Commodore-Vic-20

The schematic for the Commodore VIC-20 (251027-01 Rev D) was taken from the 
schematics on zimmers.net with extra detail from the "Vic-20 friendly computer 
technical manual" and converted into KiCad (Version 7).

Additionally includes some KiCad footprints and symbols for the custom components.

## Notes

This is a WIP as the documentation and detail on the actual PCB are far from
clear and require some deciphering.

The power management section of the board in particular is unfinished.

The PCB design, while true to the original, is not intended for fabrication.
Instead the board has been reconstructed for the purpose of diagnosing faults
on original Commodore boards. The overall board dimensions are accurate but
the positioning of the different ports are approximations based on the rather
distorted board scans in the technical manual.
